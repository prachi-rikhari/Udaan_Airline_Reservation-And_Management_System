**Udaan- Airline Reservation And Management System**
About the Project
Udaan-Airline Reservation and Management System is my academic group project, which I have done in my first year of undergraduation. This project mainly includes following things-

**Language Used -** **Java Core**

**Concept Used -** **Swing**

**IDE Used -** **Eclipse IDE**

**Database Used - Microsoft Access**

We have done all coding on Eclipse IDE using **Java **as a programming language. Java has been chosen as the platform because of its feature-rich nature. It provides robust end-to-end solutions for networked applications as well as a trusted standard for embedded applications. So, Java was a natural choice for the development process. The main concept that we have used in this project is of Swing. "Swing" refers to the new library of GUI controls (buttons, sliders, checkboxes, etc.) that replaces the somewhat weak and inflexible AWT controls. The Swing classes eliminate Java's biggest weakness: its relatively primitive user interface toolkit. **MS Access or Microsoft Access**is Database Management System (DBMS) by Microsoft. In Microsoft Access, Jet Database Engine is merged with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Software development tools. We can create customizable database applications using MS Access with many built-in functions like string, numeric, date, and information functions.

In this 'Airline Reservation System Project' we have two user- **1)Customer 2)The Administrator.**

**In Customer Window** Customer is able to login , check his/her all BookingDetails,PaymentDetails,CancellationDetails,All Flights ,able to register his/her query and can also see the answer of the queries and notifications"

**In the administrative part** Anyone from admin department login and can change all the Flight information, can see all custromer ,all customer payments,cancellation, booking and query and can answer these queries as well and can also add the notification have to show on this window.


**Alhough the project already exist, but we have added some new and advantageous features. Below you can find out our features-**

1) We have separated the customer UI and the management UI so that any random user cannot modify the flight details or any other details.

2) We have added the page for asking query and another page in the Management Department to answer all the Queries.

3) Feature of adding notifications shown on the user window.

4) Sending Confirmation mail after booking.

5) We have represented the flight seats in the form of a button so that user can select the desired seat. If the seat is already booked it turns red and we have to choose another seat.

**I have added code, images used and some screenshots of my project in this repository.**
